	    Hello! My name is Laryssa Olson and I plan to major in computer science and possibly minor in graphic design. My journey started when I got my first computer in 2003. My father had gathered up a bunch of parts and built it for me to play with. At the time though, I was two. I had no idea what IBM was or how to use a mouse. Thanks to my father though I was allowed, even urged, to explore the world of computers and other technology.

			I am not all about computers, some other things I enjoy include: solving puzzles, drawing, photography, and eating pizza. I have a cat named Bella who I also adore dearly. I appreciate nature, especially the ocean, and delight in spending time with it. Nature provides a stark contrast to the hours spent at a computer. As much as I love working and learning how a computer works, I need a good balance of both.
